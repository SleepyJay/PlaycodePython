# PlaycodePython.NameDistro v 1.0

Just a really simple program to distribute an ordered collection into N buckets. 

The idea came to me when I saw last name initials being grouped into meeting time slots. This was just interesting to me one day, so I wrote a quick script.

I have two flavors:

* Simply distribute names as evenly as possible into the set of buckets
* Attempt to keep the buckets nearest to the average as possible
