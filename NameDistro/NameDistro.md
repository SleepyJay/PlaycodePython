Tested with Python 3.6.



## What is this?
An email at work went out that the company would be broken up into "groups" to attend an information session, and that we could expect to get our group by a second email. Seemed easy enough--well, yeah, the meetings happened as intended and it was pretty easy.

But I started thinking deeper about this problem. Were they trying to keep departments together? Did they occupancy constrants? Total number of meeting constraints? Did the person planning the meeting simply slice up a spreadsheet with everyone's name on it?

If we start with the idea that departments shouldn't be broken up, (so that Department A might have 5 employees and Department B might have 23 employees, etc.) it ends up being essentially the classic Knapsack Problem. 

This led me down the rabbit hole of finding "optimal" solutions and making "effectiveness" comparisions among the solutions. CompSci kind of stuff. 

So, the code in this section is about some of my thoughts. Although, in retrospet, I didn't do a great job of leaving it in an easy place to understand or pick up again. Not good.
