## Original Text

### 2017-37
You have a function rand7() that generates a random integer from 1 to 7. Use it to write a function rand5() that generates a random integer from 1 to 5.

rand7() returns each integer with equal probability. rand5() must also return each integer with equal probability.

rand5() returns each integer with equal probability. rand7() must also return each integer with equal probability.

## Dev Notes

## Todo:
1. Implement basic `rand5` and `rand7` from Python
1. Confirm equal distribution of values
1. Implement `rand5_from_rand7` and `rand7_from_rand5`
1. Confirm equal distribution of values
