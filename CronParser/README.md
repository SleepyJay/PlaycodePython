# PlaycodePython.CronParser v0.7.2

Parse a crontab and ask it questions. This version only runs in Python 3.

Should be able to parse a cron from the scheduling standpoint. 

(This had an original at-work purpose, but after the need was satisfied, my interest kind of waned.)

###Todo:
* Allow question asking (like give me all that are scheduled for x time)
* Produce an example file for testing
