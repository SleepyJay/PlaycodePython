# PlayPython.LondonTube v0.5.0

Runs with Python 3.6.

This was from an interview question. 

Given the London Tube lines (see the file 'London tube lines.csv.txt', which lists the available paths between stations).

Originally, I read the data (correctly) as describing a bunch of one-way paths. And thus I got a different answer than was expected by the interviewer. I then went back and allowed the paths to be bi-directional by option (even though in the data given they are clearly NOT bi-directional). 

Runables:

* run.py will do a sample run for the given question, once directed and once non-directed
* test_journeys.py runs some unit tests
