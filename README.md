# PlaycodePython v2.0.1

## Musings in Python 

These represent some of my small projects and experiments in Python (at least the ones I've made public). Sometimes an idea strikes me. Sometimes I read about a puzzle, code challenge, or the like. One should probably NOT conclude from this that I can only write small, limited programs. These are purposely limited in scope (more is better)!

These should all be Python 3 compatible. (But see individual projects.)

### Project Summaries:

* **BlockStacking**: Stack blocks (mathmatically) using certain sizes and conditions, for efficient run times using large data sets.
* **CronParser**: Parse a crontab and ask it questions. 
* **GridMenu**: Generic wrap-around navigation of a 2D array of symbols (mathmatically).
* **LondonTube**: Finding routes along the London Tube map (mathmatically).
* **NameDistro**: Quick and dirty packing problem for people names. 
* **PuzzleSolver**: Some algoritms to solve some generic puzzles I've encounted while playing various games.
* **RandX\_from\_RandY**: Generic way to do any rand(x) by only having access to the randomness of rand(y).
